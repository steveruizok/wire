# Wire
Wire is a Visual Scripting-framework written in TypeScript. It aims to provide some handy utilites to build basic, web-based Visual Scripting tools. It delivers class abstractions of "Nodes" and "Connections" which has to be represented by a UI.
This library is highly experimental and will probably not see any solid documentation for a while.
